title = 'Exploring Gravity: How a Lunchtime Conversation Sparked My VR Locomotion Project'
+++
This project idea actually started over lunch with my dad. I was explaining that we’d been assigned to develop a unique locomotion technique for VR in one of my classes, and I told him about my first idea — a Human: Fall Flat-inspired movement system. He didn’t seem too impressed (probably because he didn’t quite follow the game mechanics) and, being the physicist that he is, suggested something different: localized gravity.

He explained that by placing spheres that generate their own gravitational pull, players could influence their movement — adjusting velocity and trajectory in real time. That would allow for an incredible amount of freedom, as gravitational spheres could be positioned in any direction or distance, creating a completely new kind of locomotion experience.

Since my initial idea wasn’t entirely novel, I was intrigued by this concept and decided to explore it further.

In this blog, I’ll document everything — from early prototypes to the moments that nearly broke my code (and my patience). I’ll also share what I learn about locomotion and interaction inside these peculiar, shifting worlds.

What started as a lunchtime idea quickly evolved into one of the most fascinating projects I’ve worked on. So, buckle up and join me as I dive into the strange and exciting world of gravitational spheres in VR.
