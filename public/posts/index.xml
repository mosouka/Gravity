      <title>Exploring Gravity: How a Lunchtime Conversation Sparked My VR Locomotion Project</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project idea actually started over lunch with my dad. I was explaining that we’d been assigned to develop a unique locomotion technique for VR in one of my classes, and I told him about my first idea — a Human: Fall Flat-inspired movement system. He didn’t seem too impressed (probably because he didn’t quite follow the game mechanics) and, being the physicist that he is, suggested something different: localized gravity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
